2.0.1 (2017-05-27)
  * Added URL to Scala webpage in DESCRIPTION as requested by CRAN.

2.0.0 (2017-05-27)
  * Scala functions defined in R using the s$def() mechanism now specify the
    arguments using R code instead of a string snippet of Scala code.  Protocol
    overhead is reduced.  Function definition is accessible.  Caching avoids
    recompiling the same function for a big speed boost.
  * The s$do() mechanism is deprecated in favor of a simpler syntax.  For
    example, instead of s$do("scala.util.Random")$nextDouble(), use
    s$.scala.util.Random$nextDouble().
  * Scalars are now supported using the more flexible I() function and the
    "length.one.as.vector" option is removed.
  * The scalaEval, scalaGet, and scalaSet functions are removed in favor of the
    %~%, %.~%, %@%, and $ operators.
  * Support for matrices in either row-major or column-major order.
  * Support for byte/raw type.
  * Automatic garbage collection of Scala and R references.
  * RClient now provides invoke methods to simplify calling R functions from
    Scala and the scalaCallback function is removed.
  * Callbacks to the original R interpreter now properly perform lexical
    scoping as an R user would expect.
  * Option to set the port numbers for the TCP/IP sockets.
  * Fixed problem that the protocol.R may be inadvertently excluded from the
    JAR.
  * Other bug fixes, documentation improvements, behind-the-scenes
    optimization, and simplifications.
  * Bumped default Scala version to 2.12.2.

1.0.15 (2017-02-07)
  * Fixed line ending bug when embedding R in Java/Scala on Windows.
  * Bumped default Scala version to 2.12.1.

1.0.14 (2016-11-21)
  * Reinstated support for Scala 2.10 & 2.12.  Supported versions are now
    2.10.x, 2.11.x, and 2.12.x.
  * Renamed functions: 1. scalaInterpreter --> scala, 2. rscalaJar -->
   .rscalaJar, 3. rscalaPackage --> .rscalaPackage
  * Renamed 'intp*' functions to 'scala*' functions, e.g., 'intpSettings'
    became 'scalaSettings'.
  * Improved ability to find R on Windows using registry keys.
  * Added 'scalaCallback' function to wrap an R function for evaluation by
    Scala.
  * Improved input/output handling, adding the options serialize, stdout, and
    stderr options to the 'scala' function.
  * Removed 'intpLoad' function since '.rscalaPackage' provides this
    functionality.
  * Interrupts in R now close the connection rather than leaving it in an
    out-of-sync state.
  * Guard elements of the scala interpreter from access by the user through the
    '$' operator.
  * Fixed bug in return as noted by Duncan Murdoch.

1.0.13 (2016-07-07)
  * Added %@% operator for shorthand notation (e.g, "interpreter %@% snippet")
    to conveniently evaluate an expression without the overhead involved in
    returning a result.
  * Added serialize option to scalaInterpreter and intpSettings functions in R
    to control the capturing of console output.  Likewise, added
    serializeOutput field to the RClient class.  Avoiding serialization is
    faster and leads to a better experience.  Dropped the now-redundant quiet
    option.
  * Added support for 'unlimited' nested callbacks when Scala is embedded in R,
    where in practice the amount of nesting is only about a dozen if
    serialize=TRUE (because R runs of out sink resources) but is hundreds of
    levels if serialize=FALSE.
  * Restructured the package hierarchy, most notably moving RClient to
    'org.ddahl.rscala' instead of 'org.ddahl.rscala.callback'.
  * Dropped support for Scala 2.10.
  * Avoid the need to modify the original source of scala.Console object and
    the need to hijack the boot classpath.  The package now uses the standard
    'scala' executable from the Scala binary distribution, without any modified
    code and ugly hacks.

1.0.12 (2016-06-03)
  * Fast instantiation of RClient class (which was slow in 1.0.11).

1.0.11 (2016-05-12)
  * Fixed broken URL.
  * Ship R code in JARs so that rscala does not need to be installed when
    embedding R in Scala.  Add the following to your build.sbt file:
    libraryDependencies += "org.ddahl" % "rscala_2.11" % "1.0.11"

1.0.10 (2016-05-11)
  * Uploaded JARs to http://central.sonatype.org/
  * Make sure that rscala package is installed when trying to embed R in Scala.
  * Better error messages regarding compatible jars.

1.0.9 (2016-03-11)
  * Bumped support to latest Scala releases (2.11.8 and 2.10.6).
  * Fixed display of README file if no Scala installation is found.

1.0.8 (2015-12-09)
  * Put CRAN URL in canonical form.

1.0.7 (2015-12-09)
  * On Windows, fix problem embedding R within a JVM application.
  * Fixed typographical error in documentation regarding 'strintrplt' function.
  * Fixed bug causing warning 'closing unused connection ...'
  * On Windows, also look at "...Wow6432Node..." registry key.

1.0.6 (2015-05-15)
  * Removed unnecessary 'Suggests' and 'VignetteBuilder'

1.0.5 (2015-05-15)
  * Added README.html to point to paper submitted to Journal of Statistical
    Software.
  * 'scalaInfo' function is much improved and 'scalaInstall' function is new.
  * Support of arbitrary R objects to be passed as an 'RObject' in Scala.
  * Improved exception handling.
  * Improved support for directly calling methods of an reference, instantiating
    an object, and calling methods of companion objects.
  * Check that JAR and package version match in JVM-based languages.
  * Added scaladoc for 'RClient' and 'RObject'.
  * Added javadoc for 'RClient'.
  * Documentation clarifications.
  * Minor bug fixes.

1.0.4 (2015-03-24)
  * Modified 'rscalaPackage' and 'rscalaLoad' functions to conform to CRAN
    policies.
  * Support for subassignment into vectors and lists in RClient.
  * Bug fixes to respect 'java.opts' and 'java.heap.maximum' arguments.

1.0.3 (2015-03-23)
  * Added support to directly calling methods of an reference, instantiating an
    object, and calling methods of companion objects.
  * Added function 'scalap' to show the names and signatures of class and
    companion objects.
  * Added methods 'evalD0', 'evalD1', etc. and removed '%~%' method in RClient.
  * Use 'as.reference=NA' in 'intpGet' and friends so that 'as.reference=FALSE'
    is tried first and, if conversion is not possible, 'as.reference=TRUE' is
    done.
  * Added 'rscalaPackage' and 'rscalaLoad' functions to facilitate other
    packages depending on the 'rscala' package.
  * Determine Scala version using Java executable (as located by 'javaCmd'
    function) instead of Scala executable.
  * Added infrastructure to support alternative interpreters in the future.
  * Miscellaneous bug fixes.

1.0.2 (2015-03-07)
  * On Windows, if all else fails, try to find the Java installation using the
    Windows registry.
  * Facilitate other packages depending on 'rscala' by explicitly importing
    'util' package needed for 'download.file' function.

1.0.1 (2015-03-05)
  * Initial release to CRAN.

1.0.0 (2015-03-03)
  * Release to beta testers.
